To get simple node server working: npx serve



- Always add a key to a v-for loop.

- try to keep the amount of data/computed etc objects to a minumum and try to keep data closely related. if component is getting
too big and nebulous, it may be time to create a new component.

- We can use v-model with a prop in a child component by v-model:currentTag="currentTag" and emit from the child using
@click="$emit('update:currentTag', tag)"

Fake API with json-server
-------------------------
- npm install json-server --save-dev
- npx json-server db.json -p 3001
* You can now call http://localhost:3001/assignments etc and see the json.


Life-cycle hooks
----------------
- mounted - created and then rendered to the dom. (component)
- created - created but not rendered. (component)
- unmounted - is frequently used when SPAs to remove event listeners to free up memory and other things

* slots are a good way of inserting non-string content (SVGs for example), into a component

* id atts set on a template tag will be passed and assigned to the root element in the component.
* # is an alias for v-slot
