To get simple node server working: npx serve



- Always add a key to a v-for loop.

- try to keep the amount of data/computed etc objects to a minumum and try to keep data closely related. if component is getting

- We can use v-model with a prop in a child component by v-model:currentTag="currentTag" and emit from the child using
@click="$emit('update:currentTag', tag)"
